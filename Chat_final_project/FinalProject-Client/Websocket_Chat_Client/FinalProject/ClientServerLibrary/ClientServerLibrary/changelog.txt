CommonLibrary:
	*Technically a common lib isn't even needed. Could put both interfaces in their respective projects.
	Added void SendMessageToChat(string message, int chatID); to IServerAPI
	Added void void SendMessage(int clientID, int chatID, string message);
	Changed void SendNewContact(string username); to void SendNewContact(int clientID, string contactName);

Server:
	Model's "chats" param needs to be HashMap<Integer, Chat> not HashMap<Integer, Account>
	Allowing an IClient arg in Controller means that there is a loose association with Controller->IClient
		- this can't be prevented, but it might be a break of MVC. Rework?
